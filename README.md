# supono_test_task

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

Frankly speaking it isn't finished app. Here i have several things to change
-Refactor
-Auto genereate colors
-reuse exist widget
-configure local storage
- and others

But i believe that watching this app you can see my skills of creating arch. Also i know that there 
a lot of problems and i can fix them but i'm out of time. I have been working on this task for only 8 hours
i know that you have given 2 days, but i was sick, if you give me one more day i'll finish 
and do my best
